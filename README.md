# HackerRank Coding Challenges

We're going to be doing a HackerRank challenge every day!

I'll post the challenge we'll be doing every day. Commit your solution file into the appropriate folder with your name as the file name.
For example, a submission could be Aravind.java or Naren.py.
If you have any questions on the daily challenge, feel free to reach out to anyone else working on it. 


# Setting up the Challenge repo locally:

go to your command line, and navigate into the folder you want it.

run this:
`git clone https://github.com/Perilynn/HackerRank-Coding-Challenges.git`

When you want to submit your code, drop the file into the corresponding sub-folder (e.x. Combinatorics, Sorting, etc.), and run the following:

```
git add YourName.filetype       //e.x. Aravind.java
git commit -m "submission"
git pull                // to prevent conflicts, always pull first
git push origin master
```
